#Problem 1
#Problem 1a
# Answering questions from Chapter 3 'R for Data Science'
#3.2.5 Exercise 4
# Answer:
ggplot(mpg, aes(x=cyl, y=hwy)) + 
  geom_point()
# Scatter plot for hwy vs cyl

#3.2.4 Exercise 5
# Answer:
ggplot(mpg, aes(x=class, y=drv)) + 
  geom_point()
# Scatter plot for drv vs class but it is kinda worthless to use this plot to 
# analyze data as many of the data are overlapping because both class and drv 
# variable are categorical in nature

#3.3.1 Exercise 3
# Answer:
ggplot(data = mpg) + geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, colour = cty))
# ggplot(data = mpg) + geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, shape = cty)) ==Error: A continuous variable can not be mapped to shape
ggplot(data = mpg) + geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, size = cty))
# For both colour and size, the continuous variable relates to it by 
# saturation and area size respectively.Instead for categorical variable, 
# it both colour and size will have a set outcome for each category instead of a scale.

#3.3.1 Exercise 4
# Answer:
ggplot(data = mpg) + geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, colour = cty, size = cty))
# Seems like it does work, as long as both aesthetic corresponds to each other 
# to describe the variable. 

#3.3.1 Exercise 5
# Answer: Stroke controls the width of the border of certain shapes that 
# have border attribute.

#3.5.1 Exercise 4
# Answer:Faceting help us focus the trendline or pattern for each group 
# instead of an overall distribution while the colour aesthetic gives us 
# an overall pattern of the distribution. If we have a large number of groups, 
# colours will not be able discretize them much as they are limited while facets 
# will not do well trend comparison between the groups.

#Problem 1b

# independent is rejected

#new dataframe similar to above except rows with 'Nepal' is removed
chisq.test(table(tradetest1$Miss,tradetest1$country))
# obvious change in the p-value...in fact higher than 0.01 significance level; 
# it is probable that the variable
# tariff and country is not related in this case

tradetest2 <- select(filter(tradetest,country!='Philipines'), c(country,Miss)) 
# new data frame with 'Philipines removed instead
chisq.test(table(tradetest2$Miss,tradetest2$country))  
# slight change in the p-value as compared to the original chi-square test...
# well smaller than the significane level of 0.01
# In conclusion, the statistical test shows that the variable tariff and country
# are related because mainly most of the missingvalues are populated in 
# rows of country where it's Nepal
# Safe to assume the tariff is not able to be obtained for Nepal due to some challenges
